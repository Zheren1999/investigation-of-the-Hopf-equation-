Let's consider a two-dimensional medium consisting of particles moving by inertia, without intersection and in the absence of external forces. Denote $u(t,x)$ is the speed of a particle located at a point in time $t$ and space point $x$. If $x=q(t)$ is the trajectory of motion of some fixed particle, then its speed $q'(t)=u(t, q(t))$, and acceleration $q''(t)$ is equal to zero.

The resulting equation describing the evolution of the velocity field of non - interacting particles is called Hopf equation

**The analytical solution of Hopf equation**

The analytical solution of Hopf equation can be determined by method of characteristics:

where, $g$ is the continuous function.

It is necessary to invert the map $x = x_{0} + u_{0}(x_{0})t$ concerning $x_{0}$, and then substitute it into the expression for $u$ to find the explicit dependence $u = u(x,t)$ (the parametric solution), which is most often found in literature:

The solution of the Hopf equation can be easily analyzed. According to the solution, each point of the velocity profile moves with its own (constant) velocity.
In this case, the velocity profile will be deformed since faster particles will overtake the slower ones. As a result, the shape is steeper, and at time $t = t^{*}$, the gradient of $x$ becomes endless. This phenomenon is called overturning or gradient catastrophe \cite{kuznetsov2022slipping}. To find the overturning time $t^{*}$, it is necessary to calculate
derivative $\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}$:

where $J = \frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{x_{0}}} = 1 + u'_{0}(x_{0})t$ is the Jacobian of $x = x_{0} + u_{0}(x_{0})t$. It can be seen from this expression that the derivative becomes infinite for the first time when the Jacobian, $J=0$ and corresponding $t^{*}$ can be expressed as the following formula:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89813720/204052798-350cf044-3da5-41ae-8572-f38c71ed99fd.png)

This minimum corresponds to the point $x^{*}$ (the breaking point). From this, it is clear that the overturning occurs for the initial profiles with a negative derivative $u_{x} < 0$. For $t > t^{*}$, the equation $J = 0$ has two roots, respectively. The derivative goes to infinity at two points.  The area of ambiguity is between these points. From the mapping point of view, this means that the mapping $x = x(x_{0}, t)$ is single-valued â€” the equation $x = x(x_{0}, t)$ has only one (real) root $x_{0} = x_{0}(x, t)$ for all $x$. For $t > t^{*}$, the equation $x = x(x_{0} , t)$ has three roots $x_{0}$ for any $x$ from the ambiguity domain. A change in the number of roots of a mapping is called a bifurcation. In this case, one root converts to three roots at the bifurcation point $(x^{*}, t^{*}, u^{*})$. The bifurcation point is also called the cusp point.
In physics, overturning is the cause of the formation of shock waves. When approaching the overturning point, the equations of ideal hydrodynamics lose their applicability in real gas.

**Model description**

We study the Hopf equation with following limits: $0<t<1$ , $-5<x<10$, and the initial condition:

Using the the analytical solution of this problem is represented by the following formula:

We use Newton's method for two different numerical schemes (Lax-Friedrichs and MacCormack schemes) to solve the Hopf equation with the following limits and the initial condition.

# Newton's method

Newton's method (Newton-Raphson method) is an iterative numerical method for finding the root of a given function \cite{more1982newton,polyak2007newton}. The search for a solution is carried out by constructing successive approximations based on simple iteration principles. 

**Description**

To numerically solve the Eq.~(\ref{Eq.10}), by simple iteration it must be reduced to the equivalent expression Eq.~(\ref{Eq.11}).

where, $\phi$ is the contraction display. The following condition:

is used for the best convergence of the method at the next approximation point $y^*$. The solution to this equation is sought in the form:

that implies:

Assuming that the point of approximation is "close enough" to the root $\bar {y} $ and that the given function is continuous:

The final formula for $\alpha(y)$ is:

The function $\phi(y)$ is defined:

**Algorithm**

The algorithm for Newtons method can be described as follows:\\
1. Set the initial approximation $y_0$\\
2. Until the stop condition is met, which can be taken as $|y_{n+1}-y_{n}|<\epsilon$, the error is within the required limits, calculate a new approximation:

We utilize Lax - Friedrichs and MacCormack numerical schemes using Newton's method to determine the numerical solution.

# Numerical schemes

**Lax - Friedrichs**

The Lax-Friedrichs scheme is defined in numerical analysis as a method for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations based on the finite difference method \cite{duchateau2002applied}.

**Extensions to Nonlinear Problems**

The formula defines the hyperbolic system of one-dimensional conservation laws:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89813720/204053476-93cb9ecb-275f-4d35-aed4-36bb4a25525b.png)

A generalization of the Lax - Friedrichs scheme to nonlinear systems can be expressed in the following form:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89813720/204053514-f6e824a1-949e-4e2a-8ad0-4cb1afd52e7a.png)

Lax - Friedrichs numerical scheme can be used to construct higher-order schemes for solving systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations, in the same way that Euler's method is used to construct more accurate Runge-Kutta method for solving ordinary differential equations \cite{chu1978numerical}.

This scheme can be written in a conservative form:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89813720/204053570-5f17647d-254f-487a-a393-a024df710c0a.png)

The Lax - Friedrichs scheme is explicit and has approximation error is $O(\Delta t, \Delta x)$. For this reason, it is not used as often in practice. This scheme is stable under the following condition:

**MacCormack scheme**

**Difference schemes "predictor-corrector"**

Predictor-corrector schemes are a family of methods related to
algorithms designed to integrate ordinary
differential equations\cite{zhang2012predictor, butcher2016numerical}. All such techniques involve two steps \cite{press2007section}:\\
1. At the first step (predictor), some function is determined from
values calculated in the previous step to get
the approximated value of the desired function in the following
point.\\
2. At the second step (corrector), the received
approximation using the predicted value
function and another operator to interpolate the value
desired position at the same point.

The following steps can represented as the following expressions:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89813720/204053889-3c63acff-eeef-4b3a-974a-01bda884fb6d.png)

where, $u^{n+1/2}$ is the value obtained at the "predictor" step, and $u^{n+1}$ is the refined
desired value.
It can be seen that the first step is implemented using explicit methods, and
the second step is based on the application of formulas of implicit methods. On the right side, instead of the unknown value $u^{n+1}$, the result is substituted predictions $u^{n+1/2}$.

Methods using the predictor-corrector scheme:\\
1. Milne method for ODE.\\
2. Heun method (predictor - Euler's method, corrector - Trapezium method).
\\
3. Adams-Bashforth method for solutions
non-rigid boundary value problems (the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton corrector is used).\\
4. MacCormack method.\\
