investigation of the Cauchy problem for the Hopf equation with initial condition
#Hopf equation in physics
Let's consider a two-dimensional medium consisting of particles moving by inertia, without intersection and in the absence of external forces. Denote ***u(t,x)*** is the speed of a particle located at a point in time $t$ and space point $x$. If $x=q(t)$ is the trajectory of motion of some fixed particle, then its speed $q'(t)=u(t, q(t))$ and acceleration $q''(t)$ is equal to zero.
